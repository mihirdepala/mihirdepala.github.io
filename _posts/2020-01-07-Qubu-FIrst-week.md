title: Qubu First Week
---

a)	My first impression of QuBu I was impressed because of the amount of shops already accepted to be on the app and how well products were laid out for the shops. However, I was slightly conflicted because it looked, to me, similar to other apps E.g. Just eats and Deliveroo.

b)	QuBu after this week, I now know it is not like the apps I mentioned before but is an app which can easily fit into the market due to the current demand due to the Covid-19 regulations released by the Government. I also believe QuBu developed and managed to get more shops on board as well as products for existing shops beginning to be put up. I have also seen the amount of working going on behind the app understanding what will be needed from me.


c)	I enjoyed learning how the set up from the side of the shops were and how the code to set the shop and products up was done. 

d)	I did not particularly enjoy the way the data entry was done and how we had to find the products names mainly because of the large amount of time we spent doing this. I hope we can find a way to make doing this more convenient and productive.

e)	What I would do better is find a more efficient way of putting the products up on sanity as the process Shyam and I went through was quite discouraging for us to continue uploading products however we did not stop.
